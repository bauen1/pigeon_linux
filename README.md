# pigeon_linux
A busybox based linux distribution build from scratch, as light as a pigeon.

Based on [AwlsomeLinux](https://github.com/AwlsomeAlex/AwlsomeLinux) which was forked from [minimal linux](https://github.com/ivandavidov/minimal)

# dependencys
* standard dev tools, gcc, ... etc (guess how we're gonna compile the kernel)
